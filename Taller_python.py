Data Format Problem
A company has a system that obtains all the information from its customers, it has a method to collect the data obtaining this format:
"Abel Murgas 25" Name last name Age, and the company want to change the format supported by the Database.
...
Important things:
1. Some customers have a middle name and maternal last name: "Abel Jazir Murgas Tapia 25"
2. Some customers write their first or last name in lower case: "abel jazir Murgas tapia 25"
3. Some clients do not put their age: "Abel Jazir Murgas Tapia"
The expected result:
The method must be able to change this format:
"
abel murgas tapia 25
Carmen Ortega 30
july ruiz
roberto lopez
Marta Campos" (str)
to:
[
    [1,Abel,Murgas,Tapia,25],
    [2, Carmen, Ortega, 30],
    [3, Julio, Ruiz, None],
    [4, Roberto, Lopez, None],
    [5,Marta, Campos, None]
] (list)
Validation:
1- Names and lastname must begin with a capital letter
2- If the client has no age, you must put None in the last position of the list
3- Each client must have a unique code
4- The client renders a vector inside the main list
Â¡Good luck!
